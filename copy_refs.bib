// common use of drones in construction, general problems of implementing them
// project monitoring, land measurement, 3D modeling, and real-time data collection. The paper identifies the benefits of UAS,
// like automation, low costs, speed, and the collection of high-resolution images, which can replace manned vehicles and 
// satellite imagery. However, it also highlights a gap in understanding how UAS technologies are being adopted and applied in 
// real-world construction projects.

// Currently, the most 
valuable benefits of the UAS in the construction industry are 
related to automation the construction process, low cost, greater 
speed and safer real-time data collection compare with the 
traditional methods, and a reliable replacement over satellites 
and manned vehicles in terms of high-resolution images. 
However, there is a lack of exemplification and clarity of the 
actual implementation of the UAS in the construction industry in 
terms of adoption process and impacted usage.
